        That's why you should learn how to use CSS variables to reduce the
        amount of CSS code you write and take your styling to a new level.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most successful web apps have spectacular designs. Unfortunately, to
        reach the desired effects, web developers need to prepare large amounts
        of styles. This forces us to repeat values, such as colors, in many
        different elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, modern stylesheets support CSS variables, which lets you
        reduce repetition in your codebase. You don't need external tools such
        CSS modules, Less or SASS to take advantage of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this comprehensive guide, I'm going to show you how to effectively
        use CSS variables, covering basic examples in plain HTML and CSS to more
        advanced frameworks like React and Next.js.

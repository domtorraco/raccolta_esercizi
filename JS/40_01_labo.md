# Chapter 40 - Conditional branching

## Exercise 40_01.00
Write an if statement to check if the age is between 14 and 90 (inclusive).

## Exercise 40_01.05
1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.
2. Output the value of the variable to the console.
3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console, using the following syntax:
```
    if(myVariable){ 
        //action
      
    }
```
4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether the condition is not true, and create a message that will be printed to the console in that instance. You should have two if statements, one with an ! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement instead—experiment!
5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes.

## Exercise 40_01.10
Write an if statement to check if the age is NOT between 14 and 90 (inclusive).

Create two variations: the first one using the NOT operator, the second one without it.

## Exercise 40_01.15
1. Create a prompt to ask the user's age
2. Convert the response from the prompt to a number
3. Declare a message variable that you will use to hold the console message for the user
4. If the input age is equal to or greater than 21, set the message variable to confirm entry to a venue and the ability to purchase alcohol
5. If the input age is equal to or greater than 19, set the message variable to confirm entry to the venue but deny the purchase of alcohol
6. Provide a default else statement to set the message variable to deny entry if none are true
7. Output the response message variable to the console


## Exercise 40_01.20
Which of the following alerts will be executed? What will be the result of the expression inside the if statement?

```
if (-1 || 0) alert( 'first' );
if (-1 && 0) alert( 'second' );
if (null || -1 && 1) alert( 'third' );
```

## Exercise 40_01.25
1. Create a Boolean value for an ID variable
2. Using a ternary operator, create a message variable that will check whether their ID is valid and either allow a person into a venue or not
3. Output the response to the console

## Exercise 40_01.30
Write a program that takes two input numbers and returns the minimum of the two.

## Exercise 40_01.40
Write code that takes an integer input and returns 0 if it's even or 1 if it's odd.

## Exercise 40_01.45
The JavaScript function Math. random() will return a random number in the range of 0 to less than 1, including 0 but not 1. You can then scale it to the desired range by multiplying the result and using Math.floor() to round it down to the nearest whole number; for example, to generate a random number between 0 and 9:
```
// random number between 0 and 1
let randomNumber = Math.random();
// multiply by 10 to obtain a number between 0 and 10 
randomNumber = randomNumber * 10;
// removes digits past decimal place to provide a whole number 
RandomNumber = Math.floor(randomNumber);
```

In this exercise, we'll create a Magic 8-Ball random answer generator:
1. Start by setting a variable that gets a random value assigned to it. The value is assigned by generating a random number 0-5, for 6 possible results. You can increase this number as you add more results.
2. Create a prompt that can get a string value input from a user that you can repeat back in the final output.
3. Create 6 responses using the switch statement, each assigned to a different value from the random number generator.
4. Create a variable to hold the end response, which should be a sentence printed for the user. You can assign different string values for each case, assigning new values depending on the results from the random value.
5. Output the user's original question, plus the randomly selected case response, to the console after the user enters their question.

## Exercise 40_01.46
1. Create a variable called prize and use a prompt to ask the user to set the value by selecting a number between 0 and 10
2. Convert the prompt response to a number data type
3. Create a variable to use for the output message containing the value "My
Selection: "
4. Using the switch statement (and creativity), provide a response back
regarding a prize that is awarded depending on what number is selected
5. Use the switch break to add combined results for prizes
6. Output the message back to the user by concatenating your prize variable strings and the output message string


## Exercise 40_01.50
Write the code which asks for a login with prompt.

- If the visitor enters "Admin", then prompt for a password, if the input is an empty line or Esc – show “Canceled”, if it’s another string – then show “I don’t know you”.

The password is checked as follows:

- If it equals “TheMaster”, then show “Welcome!”,
- Another string – show “Wrong password”,
- For an empty string or cancelled input, show “Canceled”

## Exercise 40_01.60
This is a game between a player and the computer, where both will make a random selection of either Rock, Paper, or Scissors (alternatively, you could create a version using real player input!). Rock will beat out Scissors, Paper will beat out Rock, and Scissors will beat out Paper. You can use JavaScript to create your own version of this game, applying the logic with an if statement. Since this project is a little more difficult, here are some suggested steps:

1. Create an array that contains the variables Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
2. Set up a variable that generates a random number 0-2 for the player and then do the same for the computer's selection. The number represents the index values in the array of the 3 items.
3. Create a variable to hold a response message to the user. This can show the random results for the player and then also the result for the computer of the matching item from the array.
4. Create a condition to handle the player and computer selections. If both are the same, this results in a tie.
5. Use conditions to apply the game logic and return the correct results. There are several ways to do this with the condition statements, but you could check which player's index value is bigger and assign the victory accordingly, with the exception of Rock beating Scissors.
6. Add a new output message that shows the player selection versus the computer selection and the result of the game.
